# Simple algorithms and collections in Java exercises

## Introduction

This GitHub project was created to serve as a playground for practicing simple algorithms, Java Stream API and Java
collections.


## IDE Setup

This project uses Lombok Library which a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.

To configure your IDE for the support of Lombok, check
out [the official documentation](https://projectlombok.org/) for detail.

## Exercises

### Java Stream API

There are exercises which introduce the Stream API usage including filtering, sorting and the output to
various formats.

### Simple algorithms

1. *Change making problem* addresses the question of finding the minimum number of coins that add up to a given amount of
money.
It is a special case of the integer knapsack problem.

### Java Math Exercises
1. Count the average of 3 integers.
2. Calculate average value of integers from a list.
3. Calculate factorial for injected integer.
4. Find n-th element from the fibonacci sequence.

### Java String Exercises
1.Check if text is a Palindrome.
2.Reverse the String.

### Java List Exercises
1. FizzBuzz exercise
2. Find 2 the smallest numbers from the list. Ignore the repetitions.
3. Find 2 elements in list whose sum is closest to zero.
4. Find first element in the list starting with letter "A" with the usage of Regex.
